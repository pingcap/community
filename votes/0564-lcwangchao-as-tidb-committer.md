# A Vote for lcwangchao as TiDB committer

## Proposal

I ([@lcwangchao](https://github.com/lcwangchao)) have been working on `pingcap/tidb` for several months. I have contributed a lot of bugfixes/enhancements for TiDB, among which the most noticable one is that I'm the author of 'Local Temporary Table' in TiDB.

Here lists some details of my contributions:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alcwangchao+is%3Aclosed+).
* [Reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Alcwangchao+)

I'm looking forward to be a TiDB committer and call for a vote for the following reasons:

* My contributions covered a varity of modules of TiDB-Server(parser, executor, planner, DDL...)
* I am the one who introduce the 'Local Temporary Table' support to TiDB, which is valuable for TiDB as a database.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team TiDB

## Result

(To be updated)Conclude the voting result, including approvals and vetoes, binding and non-binding.
