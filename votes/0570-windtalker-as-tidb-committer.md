## Proposal

[@windtalker](https://github.com/windtalker) has been working on `pingcap/tidb` in the past two years. He has contributed a lot of bugfixes/enhancements for TiDB, among which the most noticable one is that he is the co-author of the 'MPP execution' in TiDB.

* [Reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Awindtalker)

I (@XuHuaiyu) hereby nominate @windtalker as TiDB committer and call for a vote for the following reasons:

* His contributions covered a varity of modules of TiDB-Server(expression, executor, planner...).
* He is the co-author of the 'MPP execution' in TiDB, which is valuable for TiDB as a HTAP database.
