# A Vote for gengliqi as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

I am excited to nominate [@gengliqi](https://github.com/gengliqi) for the role of reviewer in the TiDB repository. His consistent efforts in fixing numerous TiDB bugs have significantly improved TiDB's stability and user experience. With a deep understanding of the project, gengliqi consistently delivers high-quality code contributions, evident from his extensive GitHub commit history: [gengliqi's TiDB Contributions](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=gengliqi).

His expertise and dedication make him an ideal candidate for the reviewer role. I am confident that gengliqi will provide valuable insights and constructive feedback to enhance TiDB's development further.

I urge the TiDB community to consider gengliqi for this important role. Thank you for your attention.
