# A Vote for windtalker as TiFlash Maintainer

## Proposal

I am excited to propose the nomination of [@windtalker](https://github.com/windtalker) as a new maintainer for the TiFlash project. He has consistently demonstrated a high level of expertise, dedication, and insight into the development and enhancement of TiFlash, making significant [contributions](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/commits?author=windtalker) over the past years. In addition to his direct contributions, he has played a critical role in elevating the quality of our project by consistently [reviewing](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Awindtalker) and improving the code submissions of other community contributors. This dedication not only strengthens our codebase but also supports and enhances the skills of our entire community.

His deep understanding of the codebase, coupled with a proactive approach to addressing issues and enhancing features, has been invaluable. Furthermore, his collaborative spirit and ability to mentor and guide others have fostered a positive and productive work environment.

I urge the TiFlash community to consider [@windtalker](https://github.com/windtalker) for this important role. Thank you for your attention.
