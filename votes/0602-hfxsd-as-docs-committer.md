# A Vote for hfxsd as Docs Committer

## Proposal

[@hfxsd](https://github.com/hfxsd) has been working on TiDB documentation for the past four months. His work covers the documentation of TiDB in both Chinese and English. With a good command of technical writing knowledge, he has contributed a lot to updating and optimizing documentation. I think @hfxsd shows his qualification as a committer of the Docs Team. The details of his contributions are listed as follows:

- Authored pull requests
    - [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Ahfxsd)
    - [docs-cn](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Ahfxsd)
    - [docs-dm](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-dm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Ahfxsd)

    - [docs-dm](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-dm/pulls?q=is:pr+reviewed-by:hfxsd+is:merged+-author:ti-chi-bot)
- Resolved issues and completed tasks
    - docs: [#5457](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/issues/5457), [#6541](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/issues/6541)
    - docs-cn: [#7337](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/issues/7337)
    - Task of high difficulty: refactoring and optimizing data migration documents
