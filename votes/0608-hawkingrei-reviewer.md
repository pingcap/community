# A Vote for hawkingrei as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

[@hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei) has been working on `pingcap/tidb` for the past half year. His work covers several TiDB components(executor, expression, planner, usability, DDLâ€¦). I think @hawkingrei shows his qualification as a review of `pingcap/tidb` repository. The details of his contributions are listed as follow:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=hawkingrei).
* [Authored issues](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/created_by/hawkingrei).

There is no review from @hawkingrei since he was not the 'formal' reviewer of `tidb` repository, please let me know if you have concern on it.

I (@zimulala) hereby nominate @hawkingrei as TiDB Reviewer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team TiDB
