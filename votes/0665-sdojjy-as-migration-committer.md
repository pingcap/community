# A Vote for sdojjy as Migration committer

## Proposal

[@sdojjy](https://github.com/sdojjy) has been promoted to the reviewer of TiCDC half a year ago.

@sdojjy is leading the project 'Table Pipeline Actor refactor', which will
enhance the stability of `pingcap/tiflow`. And he is also working on the project
'Decouple PD' to make TiCDC as a self-service system.

IMO the works show the contribution of @sdojjy, as well as his sense of
responsibility to `pingcap/tiflow` project, as well as the TiCDC community.
The details of all his PRs and reviews are:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/commits?author=sdojjy).
* [Reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Asdojjy).

I (@overvenus) hereby nominate @sdojjy as TiCDC committer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team Migration

## Result

Approved by 2 binding votes:

* amyangfei (binding)
* lance6716 (binding)
