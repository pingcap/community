# A Vote for Oreoxmt as Docs Reviewer

## Proposal

[@Oreoxmt](https://github.com/Oreoxmt) has been working on TiDB documentation for the past three months. Her work focused on translating TiDB documents from Chinese to English or from English to Chinese, managing documentation projects, troubleshooting docs CI, and conducting docs usability tests. She has delivered documentation for [TiDB Developer Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dev-guide-overview) and [PingCAP Clinic](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/quick-start-with-clinic), and helped identifying slow or failed CI tests and managed to improve them.
