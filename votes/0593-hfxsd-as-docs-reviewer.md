# A Vote for hfxsd as Docs Reviewer

## Proposal

[@hfxsd](https://github.com/hfxsd) has been working on TiDB documentation for the past three months. His work covers the documentation of TiDB in both Chinese and English. Also, he gave a lot of good suggestions in his review comments. I think @hfxsd shows his qualification as a reviewer of the Docs Team. The details of his contributions are listed as follows:

- Authored pull requests
    - [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Ahfxsd): 12
