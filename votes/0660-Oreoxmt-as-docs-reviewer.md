# A Vote for Oreoxmt as Docs Reviewer

## Proposal

[@Oreoxmt](https://github.com/Oreoxmt) has been working on TiDB documentation for the past two months. Her work focused on translating TiDB documents from Chinese to English or English to Chinese, improving docs CI, and conducting docs usability tests. She has proactively identified and fixed flaws in the existing docs and provided a lot of good suggestions in her pull requests and review comments. I think @Oreoxmt shows her qualification as a reviewer of the Docs Team. The details of her contributions are listed as follows:

- Authored pull requests
    - [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3AOreoxmt): 29
