# A Vote for Icemap as Docs Committer

## Proposal

[@Icemap](https://github.com/Icemap) has been [promoted](/votes/0714-Icemap-as-docs-reviewer.md) to the reviewer role of TiDB documentation since September, 2022. His contribution mainly focuses on continuously enriching and improving [TiDB Developer Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dev-guide-overview) in both Chinese and English. He has created a lot of developer documents for various programming languages, provided numerous valuable comments during documentation reviews, and actively contributed to enhance the TiDB Developer Guide based on user feedback.
