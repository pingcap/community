# A Vote for some new Kubernetes committers and maintainers

## Proposal

As more and more new contributors contribute to the Kubernetes Team, I ([@csuzhangxc](https://github.com/csuzhangxc)) don't have enough energy and ability to maintain the related projects within the Team well, so I decided to promote some new committers and maintainers.
