# A Vote for hawkingrei as TiDB committer

## Proposal

[@hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei) has been promoted to the reviewer of TiDB on December(/votes/0643-hawkingrei-as-tidb-committer.md).

After that, @hwakingrei has actively contributed to almost all components of TiDB-server. More specificly, he contributed to [restructure tests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/26022), reported a large number of [unstable tests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/created_by/hawkingrei) and fixed many of them.

IMO the work shows the contribution of @hawkingrei, as well as his sense of responsibility to `pingcap/tidb` project, as well as the TiDB community. The details of all his PRs and reviews are:

* [140+ authored commits](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=hawkingrei).
* [200+ reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+reviewed-by%3Ahawkingrei+)

I (@bb7133) hereby nominate @hawkingrei as TiDB committer and call for a vote.

## Deadline
