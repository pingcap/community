# A Vote for Icemap as Docs Reviewer

## Proposal

[@Icemap](https://github.com/Icemap) has actively contributed to TiDB documentation for several months. His contribution covers the documentation of [TiDB Developer Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dev-guide-overview) in both Chinese and English. He has provided a lot of good suggestions in his review comments. I think @Icemap shows his qualification as a reviewer of the TiDB Docs. The details of his contributions are listed as follows:

- Authored pull requests
    - [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3AIcemap): 56

- Reviewed pull requests
    - [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3AIcemap+is%3Amerged+-author%3Ati-chi-bot+): 20
    - [docs-cn](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3AIcemap+is%3Amerged+-author%3Ati-chi-bot+): 23
- Resolved issues

    - [docs-cn](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+assignee%3AIcemap): 7
