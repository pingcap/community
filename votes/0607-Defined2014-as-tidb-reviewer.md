# A Vote for Defined2014 as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

[@Defined2014](https://github.com/Defined2014) has been working on `pingcap/tidb` for several months, he has made contributions to variety of the components of TiDB(expression, parser, DDL, executor, etc). Especially he participated in the supporting GBK charset project and now he has a good understanding of related code. The details of his contributions are listed as follows:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=Defined2014).

There is no review from @Defined2014 since he was not the 'formal' reviewer of `tidb` repository, please let me know if you have concern on it.

I (@tiancaiamao) hereby nominate @Defined2014 as TiDB Reviewer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team TiDB
