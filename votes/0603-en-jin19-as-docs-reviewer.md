# A Vote for en-jin19 as Docs Reviewer

## Proposal

[@en-jin19](https://github.com/en-jin19) has been working on TiDB documentation for the past five months. In the first three months, her work focused on translating TiDB documents from Chinese to English or English to Chinese. After that, she has extended her ability to enhance TiDB documents and provided a lot of good suggestions in her review comments. I think @en-jin19 shows her qualification as a reviewer of the Docs Team. The details of her contributions are listed as follows:

- Authored pull requests
    - [docs](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Aen-jin19): 61
