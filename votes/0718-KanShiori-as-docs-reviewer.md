# A Vote for KanShiori as Docs Reviewer

## Proposal

[@KanShiori](https://github.com/KanShiori) has been working on TiDB documentation for the past year. His contributions focus on TiDB in Kubernetes documentation. During the past year, he has proactively added missing docs and provided quality release notes. I think @KanShiori shows his qualification as a reviewer of the Docs Team. The details of his contributions are listed as follows:

- Authored pull requests
    - [docs-tidb-operator](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-tidb-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3AKanShiori): 89
- Reviewed pull requests
    - [docs-tidb-operator](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-tidb-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+reviewed-by%3AKanShiori): 65
- Resolved issues
    - [docs-tidb-operator](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-tidb-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+assignee%3AKanShiori): 23

I (@ran-huang) hereby nominate @KanShiori as Docs Reviewer and call for a vote.
