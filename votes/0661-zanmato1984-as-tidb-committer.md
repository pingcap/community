@zanmato1984 is leading the project 'Reduce the DI of TiDB runtime module', which will enhance the stability of `pingcap/tidb`. And he is acting as a consultant in almost all the jobs related to the runtime module of `pingcap/tidb`.

I (@XuHuaiyu) hereby nominate @zanmato1084 as TiDB committer and call for a vote.
