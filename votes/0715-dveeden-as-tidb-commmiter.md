# A Vote for dveeden as TiDB Committer

## Proposal

[@dveeden](https://github.com/dveeden) was voted as the TiDB reviewer [1 year ago](https://github.com/pingcap/community/pull/561), since that he made more contribution to different components of TiDB, more specially, I would like to mention those important ones:

- [the deprecation of `EOF` packet'](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/34753), which is essential to 'MySQL 8' compatibility.
- [the support of 'socket' authentication](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/27561)

IMO he shows excellent technical skills for the authentication/security of TiDB. The details of his contributions are listed as follow:

* [Authored commits](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=dveeden).
* [Authored reviews](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Adveeden)
* [Authored documentation refinements](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adveeden+is%3Aclosed)

I (@bb7133) hereby nominate @dveeden as TiDB Committer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 7 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team TiDB

## Result

To be updated.
