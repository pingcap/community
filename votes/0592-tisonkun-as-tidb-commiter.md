# A Vote for tisonkun as TiDB committer

## Proposal

[@tisonkun](https://github.com/tisonkun) has been promoted to the reviewer of TiDB on September(/votes/0546-tisonkun-as-tidb-reviewer.md), after that he has been working on `pingcap/tidb`, more actively.

Among all his contributions, the most noticable one is the 'Restructure TiDB Tests'(https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/docs/design/2021-06-27-restructure-tests.md), @tisonkun proposed the RFC and leads this project in #26022(https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/26022), now it is close to be finished. The project simplified the test framework of `pingcap/tidb`, enhanced the maintainability of test cases, and get a lot of contributors participated in it.

IMO the work shows the contribution of @tisonkun, as well as his sense of responsibility to `pingcap/tidb` project, as well as the TiDB community. The details of all his PRs and reviews are:

* [100+ authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=tisonkun).
* [210+ reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Atisonkun)
