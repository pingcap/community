# A Vote for sylzd as TiDB committer

## Proposal

[@sylzd](https://github.com/sylzd) has been promoted to the reviewer of TiDB on October(/votes/0550-sylzd-as-tidb-reviewer.md).

After that, @sylzd has actively contributed to a variety of components of TiDB-server like 'DDL', 'expression', 'executor', 'parser' and 'dumpling'. He made a series of contributions for the new feature '[Placement Rule in SQL](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/placement-rules-in-sql)' and fixed a lot of bugs of TiDB.

IMO the work shows the contribution of @sylzd, as well as his sense of responsibility to `pingcap/tidb` project, as well as the TiDB community. The details of all his PRs and reviews are:

* [40+ authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=sylzd).
* [10+ reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%sylzd)

I (@bb7133) hereby nominate @sylzd as TiDB committer and call for a vote.
