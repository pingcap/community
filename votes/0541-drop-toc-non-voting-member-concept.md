# A Vote for My Proposal

## Proposal

In the last TOC Meeting (August 27th, 2021), @zz-jason & @winkyao stated we should attract more participant on the meeting for running the community with wider voice. Although we still hold the binding vote to TOC official member, the community is open for any contributor.

In this case, "non-voting member" concept conflicts with open for attendance and non-binding vote. Thus remote the concept.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 2 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* TOC

## Result

Binding vote

* @sunxiaoguang
* @zz-jason
