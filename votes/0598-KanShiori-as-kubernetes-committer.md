# A Vote for KanShiori as Kubernetes committer

## Proposal

[@KanShiori](https://github.com/KanShiori) has been promoted to the reviewer of Kubernetes on July(https://github.com/pingcap/community/pull/499), after that he has been working on `pingcap/tidb-operator`, more actively.

Among all his contributions, some noticable contributions include [`improve the performance of cleanup BR`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4095), [`upgrade kubernetes dependency`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4161), [`separate pkg/apis and pkg/client into submodules`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4134) and [`improve the cluster deploying across Kubernetes`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pull/4252).

IMO the work shows the contribution of @KanShiori, as well as his sense of responsibility to `pingcap/tidb-operator` project, as well as the TiDB community. The details of all his PRs and reviews are:

* [60+ authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AKanShiori+).
* [30+ reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3AKanshiori)

I [@csuzhangxc](https://github.com/csuzhangxc) hereby nominate [@KanShiori](https://github.com/KanShiori) as Kubernetes committer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.
