# A Vote for xuyifangreeneyes as TiDB Committer

## Proposal

[@xuyifangreeneyes](https://github.com/xuyifangreeneyes) has contributed a lot to TiDB's planner.
- He implemented the global kill for TiDB so that we can kill the process across the TiDB node, instead of just being able to kill the process of the corresponding TiDB node. 
- He implemented the ANALYZE TABLE COLUMN and ANALYZE TABLE PREDICATE COLUMN so that we can analyze the wide table efficiently. 
- He contributed to the index selection system of the TiDB, helping TiDB choose the correct index more robust.
- Besides, he also solved a lot issues of the TiDB. [His commits](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=xuyifangreeneyes).

I (@winoros) hereby nominate @xuyifangreeneyes as TiDB committer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.
