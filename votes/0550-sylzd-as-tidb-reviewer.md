# A Vote for sylzd as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

[@sylzd](https://github.com/sylzd) has been working on `pingcap/tidb` for several months, he has made contributions to variety of the components of TiDB(privileges, planner, statistics, executor, DDL...). IMO he shows good technical inspection from the discussions in the PRs. Also, @sylzd participated in the developments of 'temporary table' and finished a series of TODOs(#27323, #26775, #27363..). The details of his contributions are listed as follow:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=sylzd).

There is no review from @sylzd since he was not the 'formal' reviewer of `tidb` repository, please let me know if you have concern on it.

I (@bb7133) hereby nominate @sylzd as TiDB Reviewer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team TiDB

## Result

Conclude the voting result, including approvals and vetoes, binding and non-binding.
