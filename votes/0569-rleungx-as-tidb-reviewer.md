# A Vote for rleungx as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

[@rleungx](https://github.com/rleungx) has been working on `pingcap/tidb` for the past half year. His work covers several TiDB components(executor, storage and security, usability, DDLâ€¦). Also, he gave a lot of good suggestions in the review comments. I think @rleungx shows his qualification as a review of `pingcap/tidb` repository. The details of his contributions are listed as follow:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=rleungx).
* [Reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Arleungx).
* [Authored issues](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Arleungx).

I (@zimulala) hereby nominate @rleungx as TiDB Reviewer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.
