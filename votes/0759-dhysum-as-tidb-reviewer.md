# A Vote for BornChanger as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

[@dhysum](https://github.com/dhysum) has been working on `pingcap/tidb` and the related repositories like 'tikv/tikv' for more than 6 months, although there aren't many pull requests by him, he shows experience and deep insight of the database system when doing the refactor of `FieldType` of TiDB:

* [#40041](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40041) and related issue [#39751](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/39751)

The work has been done with great effort and it obviously improved the maintainability of the TiDB repository, all his contributions are listed here:

* [Authored commits](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=dhysum).
* [Authored reviews](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Adhysum)

I (@Benjamin2037) hereby nominate @dhysum as TiDB Reviewer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

* Team TiDB

## Result

To be updated.
