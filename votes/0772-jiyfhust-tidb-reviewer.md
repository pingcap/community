# A Vote for jiyfhust as TiDB Reviewer

## Proposal

[@jiyfhust](https://github.com/jiyfhust) has been contributing code to `pingcap/tidb` since 4 years ago and has helped fix a lot of bugs in the last 6 months (several of which are at major security level and above). His work covers several TiDB components(executor, DDL, usability and so on). Also, he gave a lot of good suggestions in the review comments.

I think @jiyfhust shows his qualification as a reviewer of `pingcap/tidb` repository. The details of his contributions are listed as follow:

* [Authored pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/commits?author=jiyfhust).
* [Reviewed pull requests](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Ajiyfhust).
* [Authored issues](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Ajiyfhust).

I (@zimulala) hereby nominate @jiyfhust as TiDB Reviewer and call for a vote.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope
