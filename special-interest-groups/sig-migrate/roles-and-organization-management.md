# SIG-Migrate Roles and Organization Management

## Join and Promotion

Here we mainly follow the instructions in [TiDB Developer Group](../../architecture/README.md#tidb-developer-group), including common requirements, responsibilities and privileges of each community role.

### Join

You are welcomed to be a [contributor](../../architecture/README.md#contributor) once one of your PR about data migration is merged.
To have a discussion with us, just join our slack channel **[#sig-migrate](https://slack.tidb.io/invite?team=tidb-community&channel=sig-migrate&ref=github_sig)** in [tidbcommunity](https://pingcap.com/tidbslack) Slack workspace.

### Promotion

Promotion by PR contributions will be automatically performed every 2 weeks, before the regular meeting.

If any person solved enough hard or medium issues and wish to be promoted, they or the nominator should file a pull request to this (`pingcap/community`) repository and update the member list. The PR description should link to all issues involved.

In both cases, the member list update should be announced during the regular meeting and merged after 24 hours if there are two approvals and no opposition.
