# Special Interest Groups

The TiDB project is organized primarily into Special Interest Groups
(SIG). Each SIG is comprised of members from multiple companies and
organizations, with a common purpose of advancing the project with respect to a
specific topic, such as Parser/Expression/Planner. Our goal is to enable a
distributed decision structure and code ownership, as well as providing focused
forums for getting work done, making decisions, and onboarding new
contributors. Every identifiable subpart of the project (e.g., github org,
repository, subdirectory, API, test, issue, PR) is intended to be owned by some
SIG.
