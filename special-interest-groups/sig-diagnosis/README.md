# Diagnosis Special Interest Group (sig-diagnosis)

We focus on improving the diagnosability and observability of TiDB core components (TiDB, TiKV and PD).

Common approaches may be introducing new UI pages in [TiDB Dashboard](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tidb-dashboard), improving the embedded Prometheus and Grafana user experience, refining logs, metrics and alerts, implementing new fields for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` outputs, etc.
