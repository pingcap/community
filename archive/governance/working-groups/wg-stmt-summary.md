# Statement Summary Working Group

## Goals

Discussion on the design of statement summary tables in TiDB.

Now we have a statement summary table [events\_statements\_summary\_by\_digest](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/performance/statement-summary/), and more features are being added to it. But we also have some details to be discussed.

## Meetings

Currently, we don't have an open meeting because there's only one developer in this working group.
