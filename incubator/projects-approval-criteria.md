# Projects Approval Criteria

Every Incubation project has an associated maturity level. 
Proposed Incubation projects should state their preferred maturity level. 
A vote is required for a project to be accepted into the corresponding 
maturity stage - Incubating, or Graduated.

## Existing Code

New projects can be spun off from the main repository of 
existing projects to allow projects to iterate or release independently.

Part of the following maturity criteria are inspired by [CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en):

## Incubating Stage

- The project must be designed to extend the functionality or capabilities of one or more existing TiDB projects.
- Has basic project information files, including:
  - README.md
  - LICENSE (Apache 2)
- Adopt the [TiDB Community Code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- The source code is stored on Github.
- Has at least 2 committers.
- Approved by TOC.

## Graduation Stage

To graduate from incubating status, or for an existing project to join as graduated, a project must meet the following criteria:

- Has detailed user documentation and basic reference manuals.
- Has an automated continuous integration test infrastructure (CI).
- Has a clear member promotion path, with basic community governance documentation(can follow the governance of TiDB Community).
- A user list with at least 2 users applying the project in a production environment.
- Has a clear plan for the Roadmap and the next version, which can be described by GitHub milestone or documentation.
- Has a clear release method and release cycle, with release notes provided for every release.
- Approved by TOC.

Projects can remain in an incubating state indefinitely, but they are normally expected to graduate within 12 months. If the project fails to graduate within 12 months, TOC has the right to decide whether to stop incubating the project.
