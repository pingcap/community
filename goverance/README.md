## Code of Conduct

See TiDB [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Community Architecture

See [TiDB Community Architecture](../architecture/README.md) for more details.

## Community Groups

TiDB has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

### Working Group(WG)

**Working Groups (WGs)** are temporary groups that are formed to address issues
that cross SIG boundaries. Working groups do not own any code or other long
term artifacts. Working groups can report back and act through involved SIGs.

#### WG Goverance(WIP)

#### WG Lifecycle(WIP)

### Special Interest Group(SIG)

**Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on a
module of TiDB. SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings. The purpose of
a SIG is to own and develop a module of TiDB.
