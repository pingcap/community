# High-Performance TiDB Challenge

High-Performance TiDB Challenge is a mentoring program which focuses on workload optimization to bring TiDB performance to a higher level. Several typical workloads in need of optimization are now open for participants to discuss and work on. Completion of each challenge task under the selected workload is recognized through challenge points, which could be redeemed into cash awards and swags.

## Program Timeline

## Participation Notes

Glad you are interested! Before you start hacking, these are something you should know to get you started quickly.

### About team-up

* You need to team up before submitting the [application form](https://forms.pingcap.com/f/high-performance-challenge-en). One team could only select one workload for optimization.
* Up to five participants are allowed in a team; cross team-up is not allowed.
* If you have trouble in team-up, give a shout in the Slack channel for help. Or you can sign up as a one-person team.

### About challenge points

* Your team only earns points when you resolve the issues that you created for your target workload optimization. If the issues resolved are not relevant, there will be no points granted.
* The team points are the sum of the points of all the tasks completed by your team members.
* The leaderboard in real time does not indicate the final team rankings. See [Evaluation criteria](#evaluation-criteria) for all the factors at play.
* The organizing committee determines the challenge points for the created issues under each workload. The points are determined according to the team's estimated work.

### About mentors

* Only one mentor is allowed in a team and one mentor could only provide instructions to one team.
* The team that needs mentoring could contact the organizing committee in the Slack channel.

### Evaluation criteria

The results of the challenge will be evaluated in teams. The organizing committee will pull the latest working branches of each team at 18:00 on Nov.15 (China Standard Time) to evaluate workload optimization results and calculate the total PR points of each team. Besides, each team has 7 minutes to present their teamwork for the optimization on Nov.21.

**The final ranking is determined by:**

* Performance improvement (65%): performance improvement (percentage) of the working branch compared with the base Master branch
* PR points of the team (30%): the validated PRs merged into Master
* Presentation (5%): presentation performance

## Before participation

### Step 2: Submit your working branch

The team leader submits a working branch off the master branch of 16:00 on Sept.17 (China Standard Time). This must be done within 5 working days after signing up.

The hash value of the base master version is:

```
tidb:1bfeff96c7439ed672f8362cf67573666a43f781
tikv:dcd2f8f4076d847151fdf58e9c0ba333f242d374
pd:c05ef6f95773941db5c1060174f5a62e8f864e88
```

> **Note**: The working branch created here is only for submitting the code change from your workload optimization task. After it's created, DO NOT merge the master branch into it. At the end of the program, the working branch will be compared with the base master version to get the exact performance improvement and determine the final points of each team.

### Step 3: Start optimization

In this period, your team will be working together with the mentor to diagnose performance bottlenecks for the selected workload. Once the performance bottlenecks are identified, you need to:

1. Create the corresponding issues in the format of `hptc WorkloadName IssueName`, for example: `hptc sysbench-Oltp_Read_Only Update a config`

    Once you finish creating issues, a bot automatically notify the organizing committee to rate the issues and label them with the points that will be granted. Make sure you mention this issue number in the corresponding PR.

2. Start optimizing by solving the issues.

    Submit your change as a Pull Request (PR) to your working branch, in the format as specified below:

    * Complied to [Commit Message and Pull Request Style](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/contributors/commit-message-pr-style.md) for the PR title
    * `hptc` should be indicated in the first line of PR description
    * The target workload should be indicated in the PR description, such as `performance/tpcc`
    * The corresponding issue number should be indicated in the PR description, such as “Issue Number: #xxx”

### Step 5: Submit code change

Submit your code change to the master branch before 18:00 Nov.15 (China Standard Time). PRs merged after Nov.15 will not be counted for the points.

### Step 6: Points granted

PRs merged into the master branch during the competition will be automatically granted the points as labeled on the corresponding issue. If a merged PR does not receive any points, please check whether the PR has been submitted according to the PR format requirements, or contact the organizing committee in the slack channel.

### Step 7: Present your work

Submit your presentation slides before 10:00, Nov.20 (China Standard Time). The presentation should be no longer than 7 minutes, with the following topics covered:

* Introduction to the workload situation before and after your optimization
* Work allocation among team
* Performance improvement

The online presentation will be held at 13:00-17:00, Nov.21 (China Standard Time). The challenge results will be announced after the presentation.

## Awards

* 1st prize: 7,000 US dollars for the team; 1,350 US dollars for the mentor
* 2nd prize: 4,250 dollars for the team; 1,350 US dollars for the mentor
* 3rd prize: 1,350 US dollars for the team

>**Note**: Teams that finish the final presentation will be evaluated by the judges, among which no more than five winning teams will be generated. The winning teams will be awarded as described above. Each member of the finisher team can get a special swag. If the winning team does not have a mentor, the mentor prize will be automatically added to the team.
