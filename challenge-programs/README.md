# TiDB Challenge Program

We’re thankful to all TiDB contributors for each and every contribution you made! As the TiDB community expands and the project evloves, we’re inspired to see more and more developers joining us and demonstrating their passion and pursuit of the open-source spirit. TiDB could not be what it is today if it were not the community.

In order to bring TiDB to a new level in terms of stability, performance, and usability, we decided to launch the TiDB Challenge Program! It is a series program where issues of the specified theme will be opened for the participants to discuss and solve together. Once a task from the Challenge Program is completed, it will be counted in score under the name of the participants. At the end of each season of the program, top contributors will receive awards based on their final scores!

Here are a list of projects available for your choice. You can check all the open issues of your interested project in the TODO Columns (Currently applicable to Challenge Program Season 2):
