# TiDB Challenge Program

We’re thankful to all contributors of the TiDB open-source community for every contribution to TiDB! We’re inspired to see more and more developers joining our community and demonstrating their passion and pursuit of open-source spirit. TiDB continues to evolve on and on, empowered by the open-source community!

We really appreciate and always believe in the power of the open-source community, so in order to raise TiDB to a new level in terms of stability, performance, usability, we decided to launch the series of TiDB Challenge Program! There some issues will be opened for the programmers to discuss and solve together. Completed a task that’s part of the Challenge Program, we’ll make a note of it. At the end of each season, we’ll be offering some rewards to top contributors!
