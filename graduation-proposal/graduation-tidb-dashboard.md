## TiDB Dashboard Graduation Proposal

TiDB Dashboard is a Web UI for monitoring, diagnosing and managing the TiDB cluster.

On behalf of the maintainers team, we believe Dashboard is ready for [graduation stage](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/incubator/projects-approval-criteria.md#graduation-stage).
