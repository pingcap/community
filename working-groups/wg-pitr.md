# PITR Working Group

PITR(Point in Time Recovery) is an ecosystem tool for TiDB Binlog. By preprocessing the incremental backup file of TiDB, PITR merged the changes of the same line of data to produce a new, lighter incremental backup file, which greatly reduced the Time of incremental backup Recovery and realized fast-pitr.
