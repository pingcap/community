# Working Groups

Working Groups provide a formal avenue for disparate groups to collaborate
around a common problem. A working group represents the interest of the group
and serves as a vehicle for a consensus building. If the code is developed as
part of the collaboration within the Working Group, that code will be housed in
an appropriate repository as described in the repository document. Merging of
this code into the repository will be governed by the related standard
policies.

## Working Group Governance

See [Working Group Governance](../governance/wg-governance.md) for details.
