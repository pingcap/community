# DM-Syncer Working Group

We used `Syncer` to synchronize binlog from MySQL to TiDB Cluster. After **Data Migrants**(abbr. DM) which is a stronger and stabler fixture has been developed , we rarely maintain `Syncer`.
But some users are still using old version of `Syncer`. For smoothly upgrading, it's better to compile binlog repliaction unit in DM indenpendently and be compitable with old config format as possible as we can.
