# TiDB Community Governance

This document describes the governance rules of the TiDB Community. It is meant to be followed by all the repositories in the [PingCAP organization](https://github.com/pingcap) and the TiDB community.

## Code of Conduct

The TiDB community follows the [TiDB Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Here are some excerpts:

> In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Community Structure

The TiDB community consists of User Group and Developer Group.

### User Group

The TiDB User Groups (TUGs) are groups for facilitating communication and discovery of information related to topics that have long term relevance to large groups of TiDB users.

See TiDB documentation in [English](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable) or [Chinese](https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/stable). You can also get help in [AskTUG.com (Chinese)](https://asktug.com/) if you encounter any problem.

### Developer Group

* **[Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](toc/README.md)** serves as the main bridge and channel for coordinating and information sharing across companies and organizations. It is the coordination center for solving problems in terms of resource mobilization, technical research and development direction in the current community and cooperative projects.

* **[Teams](teams/README.md)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the TiDB projects. A team has its reviewer, committer and maintainer, and owns one or more repositories. Team level decision making comes from its maintainers.

See their specific governance documents for more details.
