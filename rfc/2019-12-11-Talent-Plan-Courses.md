## Abstract

There are plenty of people interested in TiDB but lacking background knowledge, so we propose to create a series of courses to help those people enter the field infrastructure systems and TiDB ecosystem. Course participants should have developed good knowledge and skills in system programming after finishing course materials.

## Proposal

![course map](./course-ex.png)

The above is a introduction of the course system. This series of courses include but not limited to the principle of computer system design, but also programming language, open source cooperation, and more. The development of a distributed database system course is on the way, more courses will be created in the future. We hope those courses can make benefit to everyone.

## Rationale

There are many open study resources online, our courses can borrow ideas from world top universities also MOOCs. The courses would be practice-concentrated, well-designed programming assignments are the core, reading materials including slides, notes is also irreplaceable.

## Compatibility

N/A

## Implementation

To implement it, we need the following main steps:

- Discuss the subject must be included in the course system.
- Divide the subject topics, and assign them to course developers.
- Create the programming assignments framework, also reading materials.

## Open issues (if applicable)
