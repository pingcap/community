## Abstract

Since there are plenty of people interested in TiDB but lack background knowledge, so we propose to create a series of computer system courses to help those people enter the field of the TiDB ecosystem, also computer system infrastructure. Course participants should have developed good knowledge and skills in system programming after consumed course materials.

## Background

The campus is always an important member of the TiDB Community, and we hope more young blood from universities or other fields can embrace the TiDB ecosystem, so we think a series of courses about computer systems is necessary for helping more people get in touch with TiDB.

## Proposal

This series of courses concentrate on computer system related fields, include but not limited to the database system, distributed system. The development of a distributed database system course is on the way, more course will be created in the future. We hope those courses will push the campus computer system education forward.

## Rationale

There are many open study resources online, our courses can borrow ideas from world top universities also MOOCs. The content of courses would focus on practice, well-designed programming assignments are the core, reading materials including slides, notes is also irreplaceable.

## Compatibility

TiDB will not be affected by this project.

## Implementation

To implement it, we need the following main steps:

- Discuss the topics must be covered in reading materials, and contents of programming assignments.
- Divide the course contents into multiple topics, each one will be handled by course development participants.
- Create the programming assignments framework, also reading materials.

## Open issues (if applicable)
