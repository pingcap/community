## Background

Talent Plan is a study project developed by PingCAP, which aims to help people get in touch with TiDB and TiKV. At the moment, only two study roadmaps were provided, and the content is not well-designed. So we propose Talent Plan Courses, a new version of the study project that contains more topics and elaborate contents.

## Course Framework

The picture above shows the latest framework of Talent Plan Courses. In addition to TiDB related learning materials, lots of other sections also will be provided. Courses can be combined according to students' interests and goals. For example:

- Multiple programming language courses are on the list, and this is a great help for people without related experience to learn quickly.
- A course about the distributed Key-Value database internal is provided for storage enthusiasts.
- Database enthusiasts can implement a small distributed database by learning Go language, distributed relational database course, and Deep Dive into TiDB.
- Open source enthusiasts can better understand open source software, open source community operation by learning courses related to open source collaboration and practicing in TiDB open source community.

In addition to the learning path planned by the Talent Plan, you can create your own learning path according to your own needs. As the development of courses, more topics and the detailed course contents would be appended in the future.

## Rationale

There are many open study resources online, we can gather those materials together to make the learning path easier. Furthermore
the courses will be practice-oriented, elaborately designed programming assignments as the core, which can help participants to check their learning outcomes.

## Compatibility

## Implementation

The implementation of the course requires the following 3 main steps:

- Discuss the overview course framework of the new version.
- Make agreements of the syllabus for each course
- Fill in learning materials and assignments.
- Optimize assignment submission and evaluation.

## Open issues (if applicable)
