There are plenty of people interested in TiDB but lacking background knowledge, so we propose to create a series of courses to help those people enter the field of infrastructure systems and TiDB ecosystem. After learning the series of courses, course participants should be able to develop good knowledge and skills in system programming.

## Course design

The picture above is the design of the course system. This series of courses include but not limited to infrastructure systems, the programming language to be used, and open-source collaboration. The development of a distributed database system course is in progress, and more courses will be provided in the future.

## Rationale

There are many open study resources online. Our courses can borrow ideas from world-class universities and MOOCs as well. The courses will be practice-oriented, with well-designed programming assignments as the core. Reading materials are also included.

## Compatibility

N/A

## Implementation

The implementation of the course requires the following 3 main steps:

- Discuss the subject to be included in the course system.
- Divide the subject topics, and assign them to course developers.
- Create the programming assignment framework and prepare the corresponding reading materials.

## Open issues (if applicable)
