To make TiDB 4.0 experience available earlier, we invite you to participate in TiDB 4.0 Bug Hunting Program, where you could report bugs that affect your experience while exploring TiDB 4.0. Sponsored by PingCAP and launched by the TiDB developer community,  this program aims to bring a better experience of TiDB 4.0 to the global community.

### Step 2: Report the bug

If you find any bug in step 1, report it as an issue in [bug-hunting/issue](https://github.com/tidb-challenge-program/bug-hunting-issue). The title of the issue should be in the format below:

```
Pn-[4.0-bug-hunting]-[feature-names]-brief-descriptions
```

where:

*   Pn indicates the bug level. It is recommended you include an estimated bug level in the title according to the level table below. This makes the review process easier and more efficient.
*   The issue title and content should be written in English.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
Bug level
<p>
(in descending order)
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
   <td>Examples
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>P0
   </td>
   <td>Data accuracy or service usability is affected.
   </td>
   <td>
<ol>

<li>Serious issues such as data loss and errors, wrong results returned by the query, and inconsistent results returned by the SQL output, etc.

<li>Usability issues, such as service inaccessible for more than 30 seconds

<li>Process crash, etc.
<br /> Note: rare corner cases might be downgraded as deemed appropriately.

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Note:** The QA team from PingCAP reserves the right of interpretations with regard to the rating results.

### Step 3: Evaluate the bug and grant points

1. The QA team from PingCAP will label the bug according to the bug level. If you are the first one to report the bug,  you will be granted the corresponding points for you based on the points table below. The sre-bot will automatically reply “Thank you for your contribution, you have been awarded xx points!”

   The points will be granted based on the following table:

   | Bug Level (Descending)| Points |
   | ---------------- | ---- |
   | P0               | 1000 |
   | P1               | 500  |
   | P2               | 100  |
   | P3               | 50   |

2. If the reported issue is verified not to be a bug, the QA team will label it as “non-bug” and close the issue. In this case, don't be frustrated and keep on hunting.

### Step 4: Redeem points

If the reported bug is confirmed as valid, you could check the above table to confirm whether the received points are correct.

**Points bonus**

When the issue is verified to be reproducible with clear steps, there will be an additional 100 points granted.

The leaderboard of the points will be displayed on [TiDB 4.0 Bug Hunting website](https://pingcap.com/community-cn/tidb-bug-hunting)(In Chinese). The points could be redeemed for PingCAP contribution prizes, including but not limited to TUG T-shirt, PingCAP portable charger, and TUG hoodie, and more.

> **Note:** Prizes like PCTA or PCTP certification (TiDB professionals recognized by PingCAP) coupon might not be supported if you are not within China or don't speak Chinese.

**When to redeem:**

The points are valid for redemption within a year after the current season. For example, if season 1 ends on April 30, the points are valid for redemption until April 30, 2021.

**How to redeem:**

Fill out the prize redemption table (accessible when redemption is available).

## FAQs（Updating in Progress)

**Q1: How do I change the registration information? How will the points change after the registration information is changed?**

**Answer**: To change the registration information, you need to close the original registration issue and open another issue for registration. Editing on the original issue is not supported for the time being. There are three cases of changes in points after the registration information is changed:

*   Adding or reducing team members will not affect the total points of the team;
*   The individual points of new members joining the team will be frozen to the state before joining the team, and the points earned after joining the team will be owned by the team;
*   Participants who leave the team and rejoin as individuals do not inherit team points.

**Q2: Can I invite PingCAP's internal employees to team up?**

**Answer**: Of course you can! We welcome our community members to team up with PingCAP employees. If you don’t know any PingCAPers, shout out in the **#everyone** slack channel. To ensure the fairness of the event, the team that include PingCAP employees will be marked with a star (*). Their bug hunting points will not be included in the final ranking, but are valid for the prizes redemption.

**Q3:  Are the bugs reported here available to be picked for the 4.0 [TiDB Usability Challenge Program](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/challenge-programs/challenge-program-season-2.md)?**

**Answer**: Of course YES! We would love to see  [TiDB Challenge Program](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/challenge-programs/challenge-program-season-2.md) participants  help us fix these issues!  Challenge points will be granted once you successfully pick one and fix it.

The rules are as follows:

1. You could pick up any issue labeled as “challenge-program-2” by commenting “/pick up challenge”.

2. The bot automatically replies “pick up success, PTAL@point-team” when detecting your pickup comment. Then the issue is picked up successfully.  

3. When the issue is picked, the rating team from the challenge program rates the issue by commenting the points, for example “/bug point 1000” (generally within 3 work days).  The rated points will be updated automatically in the description of this issue.

> **Note:**
> 
> *   After claiming the issue, you don’t have to wait for the rating to finish before you  submit the PR. If the issue is not rated after 5 days since it is claimed, you could request points rating again.
> 
> *   When the issue is claimed,  follow the steps in [TiDB Challenge Program Season 2](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/challenge-programs/challenge-program-season-2.md) to help fix issues.
