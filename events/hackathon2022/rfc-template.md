### Project description

A brief introduction that helps readers understand your RFC

### Background & motivation

What's the background of your design? What's the problem you're trying to solve? What use cases does your project support?

This section doesn't need much detail, but you must introduce your project's motivation or  background. You need to tell readers where your project's requirements come from and what problem your project solves.

### Project design

Give a detailed explanation of your design, including your application's architectural design and what problem you want to solve by using TiDB's feature. Explain how you'll implement your design, analyze cases using examples, and introduce how to use your feature.

You can write pseudocode of the important algorithms, API interfaces, UML diagrams, and components you'll modify.

## An RFC explanation video (optional)

You can record a short RFC explanation video to let judges have a better understanding of your project.
