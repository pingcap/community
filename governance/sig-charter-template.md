# SIG Charter Template

This charter follows the TiDB Community charter and institution, using the role definitions and responsibilities in [SIG Governance](sig-governance.md). Each SIG needs to have its own charter that defines the responsibilities and contribution scope of the SIG. Each SIG institution can be consistent with the “charter template” or it can have its own defined rules, depending on the needs of the special SIG.

## Responsibility

Please describe the module that the SIG is responsible for, and a brief introduction to the module. It is used to introduce the SIG to new members.

## Code, Binaries and Services

- Test specifications and integration test specifications to be followed
- Required responsible code range and location
- Product Design and Evolution Proposal
- Review code owned by the SIG.

## Other Regulation Process

- Organize and guide SIG internal and external personnel, precipitation learning materials and video
- Organize regular weekly meetings and keep a record
- Organize task assignment and time planning
- Organize the activities of online and offline members
- Define active rules of SIG and promotion mechanism

## Non Responsibility

Describes the current issues related to the modules covered by the SIG, but does not require the SIG's concerns. Take the Document SIG example:

- There is no need to create a new feature document, the developer is responsible for that, and the Document SIG is responsible for reviewing and suggesting.
- Branding, logo design, campaign, recruitment, etc.
- Product Release notes, etc.
