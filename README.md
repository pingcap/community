# How do I Become a Committer?

First of all you need to get involved and be a Contributor.

Once you're contributing and your work is good, one of our Maintainer or PMC member may invite you to be a committer (after we've called a vote). When that happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place...

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches; it‘s also about helping out on the development and user [Discussion Forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidb-user), helping with documentation and the issues.

See [Become a Committer](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/become-a-committer.md) for becoming a committer steps and more details.
