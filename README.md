# TiDB Community
![TiDB Community Logo](./TiDB_Community_Logo.svg)
Welcome to the TiDB Community! The main objective is to help members of the
TiDB community who share similar interests to learn from and collaborate with
each other.

Your journey of becoming a contributor and committer starts from here:
improving docs, improving code, giving talks, organizing meetups, etc.

## Architecture

## TiDB User Group

The TiDB User Groups (TUGs) are groups for facilitating communication and discovery of
information related to topics that have long term relevance to large groups of
TiDB users.

See [docs](https://pingcap.com/docs/) or
[docs-cn](https://pingcap.com/docs-cn/) for user documents. Also you can get
help in [AskTUG](https://asktug.com/) if you met any problem.

### Communication

The [communication](./communicating.md) page lists communication channels like
chat, social medias, etc.

For more specific topics, join
[https://pingcap.com/tidbslack](https://pingcap.com/tidbslack) and discuss with others.

### Governance

TiDB has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

* **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on a
  module of TiDB. SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings. Anyone is
  welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the TiDB [Code of
  Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a
module of TiDB.

* **Working Groups (WGs)** are temporary groups that are formed to address
  issues that cross SIG boundaries. Working groups do not own any code or other
  long term artifacts. Working groups can report back and act through involved
  SIGs.

### How to contribute

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.

You can start by finding an existing issue with the
[help-wanted](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
label in the tidb repository. These issues are well suited for new contributors. BTW,
there's always a need for more test coverage. You can also start with an area
that has [low coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/pingcap/tidb).

You can also join one of the [active working groups](./working-groups) to
participate in a community activity. Start with attending working group meetings or
joining the slack channel.
