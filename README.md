Welcome to the TiDB Community! The main objective is to help members of the TiDB community who share similar interests to learn from and collaborate with each other.

Your journey of becoming a contributor and committer starts from here: improving docs, improving code, giving talks, organizing meetups, etc.

## TiDB User Group

![User Group](media/user-group.jpeg)

The TiDB User Groups (TUGs) are groups for facilitating communication and discovery of information related to topics that have long term relevance to large groups of TiDB users.

See TiDB documentation in [English](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable) or [Chinese](https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/stable). You can also get help in [AskTUG.com (Chinese)](https://asktug.com/) if you encounter any problem.

## TiDB Developer Group

### Communication

The [communicating.md](communicating.md) file lists communication channels like chat, social medias, etc.

For more specific topics, join [TiDB Internals developer discussion forum](https://internals.tidb.io) and post topics, or [TiDB Community slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/tidbcommunity/shared_invite/enQtNzc0MzI4ODExMDc4LWYwYmIzMjZkYzJiNDUxMmZlN2FiMGJkZjAyMzQ5NGU0NGY0NzI3NTYwMjAyNGQ1N2I2ZjAxNzc1OGUwYWM0NzE) and discuss with others.

### Governance

TiDB has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

* **[Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](toc/README.md)** serves as the main bridge and channel for coordinating and information sharing across companies and organizations. It is the coordination center for solving problems in terms of resource mobilization, technical research and development direction in the current community and cooperative projects.

* **[Teams](teams/README.md)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the TiDB projects. A team has its reviewer, committer and maintainer, and owns one or more repositories. Team level decision making comes from its maintainers.

### How to contribute

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated.

See [`contributors`](contributors/README.md) for details.

All the contributors are welcomed to claim your reward by filing this [form](https://forms.pingcap.com/f/tidb-contribution-swag).
