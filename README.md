## TiDB Community

Welcome to the TiDB Community! The main objective is to help members of the TiDB community who share similar interests to learn from and collaborate with each other.

Your journey of becoming a contributor and committer starts from here: improving docs, improving code, giving talks, organizing meetups, etc.

Love you all.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.

2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.

3. If your proposed change is accepted, sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/pingcap/tidb?pullRequest=5567), and start work in your fork.

## How do I Become a Committer?

First of all you need to get involved and be a Contributor.

Once you're contributing and your work is good, one of our Maintainer or PMC member may invite you to be a committer (after we've called a vote). When that happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place...

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches; it‘s also about helping out on the development and user [Discussion Forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidb-user), helping with documentation and the issues.

See [Become a Committer.md](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/become-a-committer.md) for becoming a committer steps and more details.
