# Become a Committer

First of all you need to get involved and be a Contributor.

Once you're contributing and your work is good, one of our Maintainer or PMC
member may invite you to be a committer (after we've called a vote). When that
happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place.

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches, itâ€˜s
also about helping out on the development and user discussion forums, helping
with documentation and the issues.

# Definition of Inactive Committer and operations:

* If a Committer has not participated in project discussions or pushing forward
  the progress of the project for over three months, then the Committer is an
  Inactive Committer. Concrete behavior is as follows:

    * Absence of any community activity for over three months
    * Committer meeting
    * Project technical discussion
    * No code commits (including documentation) for over three months

* If a Committer has not committed any code for over a year, then the Active
  Committer privilege is reclaimed.
